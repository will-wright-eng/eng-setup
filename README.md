## Summary

The objective of this repo is to run a single script that sets up your new work computer -- thereby minimizing the amount of time it takes you to start doing actual work. 

__A general roadmap to onboarding can be found in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xdVpIs4Ikp3-xICkHfiQfJxsInzmZYRK6ng1AOmvxsg/edit?usp=sharing).__

The software, settings, and preferences that are configured align with standard practices I've identified within the Healthcare Solutions lair but also reflect some of my personal preferences (specifically in the `osx.sh` script). 

Be sure to run through the contents of each script and, where you deem necessary, supplement with content from the original project ([donnemartin/dev-setup](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup)).

## Setup

** still in the process of testing, feel free to raise issues or PRs **

Ideally...

1. clone repo
2. ~~enter secrets into secret folder~~ (TODO)
3. make script executable `chmod +x single_setup_script.sh`
4. run script `./single_setup_script.sh`
5. followup checklist


## Followup
